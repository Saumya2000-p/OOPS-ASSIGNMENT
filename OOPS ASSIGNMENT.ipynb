      "source": "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n1. **Encapsulation**: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or object. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant features. This allows users to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the intricacies of their inner workings.\n3. **Inheritance**: This concept allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be defined in multiple forms, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n5. **Composition**: This principle refers to building complex types by combining simpler objects. Instead of inheriting behavior from a parent class, a class can contain instances of other classes, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in design.\n\nThese concepts work together to create a more organized, reusable, and maintainable code structure in software development.",

Constructor (__init__ method): Each time an instance of InstanceCounter is created, the __init__ method increments the instance_count by 1.\n3. Class Method (get_instance_count): This method is defined with the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter. It returns the\ncurrent value of instance_count.\n4. Example Usage: Three instances of InstanceCounter are created, and the total number of instances is retrieved and printed.\n\nThis implementation provides a straightforward way to keep track of how many instances of a class have been created, demonstrating the use of class\nvariables and class methods effectively.",
